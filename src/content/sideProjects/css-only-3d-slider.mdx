## Project Overview
This side project showcases a CSS-only 3D slider, demonstrating the impressive capabilities of modern CSS techniques. By leveraging advanced CSS properties such as 3D transforms, perspective, and keyframe animations, the slider creates an engaging, interactive user interface without relying on JavaScript. This approach not only results in smooth performance but also serves as an excellent example of how far CSS has evolved in creating complex, dynamic web elements.

The project consists of a circular arrangement of images that rotate in 3D space, creating a carousel effect. It's fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes from desktop to mobile. The implementation highlights the potential of CSS for creating rich, interactive experiences, challenging the notion that such effects always require JavaScript. This slider serves as both a practical UI component and an educational tool for web developers looking to push the boundaries of what's possible with CSS.

## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to expand this project by creating more variations of CSS-only 3D animated sliders. These variations will explore different geometric arrangements, transition effects, and interaction models, all while maintaining the core principle of JavaScript-free implementation. Some ideas include:

1. A cube-shaped slider with content on each face
2. A spiral-arrangement slider with a zoom effect
3. A slider with parallax scrolling effects

Additionally, I intend to refactor the project using Tailwind CSS. This will involve:

1. Integrating Tailwind's utility classes to replace custom CSS where possible
2. Exploring how to combine Tailwind's approach with the necessary custom CSS for 3D effects
3. Demonstrating how to achieve complex layouts and animations using Tailwind's ecosystem

By incorporating Tailwind CSS, I aim to showcase how modern CSS frameworks can coexist with and enhance custom CSS techniques, even for advanced use cases like 3D animations. This evolution of the project will provide insights into balancing the convenience of utility-first CSS with the precision required for complex CSS animations.
