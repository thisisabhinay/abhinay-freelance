## SMS Provider Settings

HighLevel's SMS Provider feature simplifies text message communication within their comprehensive sales and marketing platform. Their built-in SMS provider, Lead Connector (LC), enables clients to effortlessly send and receive SMS messages.

LC provides one-click setup, potential cost savings, and seamless integration with other HighLevel features. Although client can integrate external SMS providers, LC offers benefits such as easier setup and potentially lower costs compared to using third-party providers.

## Voicemail and Missed Call Settings

Voicemail settings allow clients to upload custom voicemail greetings that play for callers who reach their voicemail. These greetings can be configured for individual phone numbers or applied to the client's entire business profile within HighLevel.

Missed Call Text Back feature allows clients to preview or automatically send a customized text message to callers who were unable to reach them.

## SMS Compliance Settings

HighLevel offers a number validation feature that helps ensure messages are sent only to valid mobile numbers. This feature can reduce the occurrence of undelivered messages and improve the sender's reputation.

SMS opt-out settings is a compliance-related feature that requires every message sent to include clear instructions on how recipients can opt out of receiving future messages. Typically, this involves incorporating a phrase like "Reply STOP to unsubscribe" within the content of each message.

SMS Sender Info is a compliance-related setting that requires each message to identify the sender. This identification can be the business name or another recognizable identifier associated with the sender.

## Messaging Limit Settings

SMS Limit applies to two specific cases. Firstly, HighLevel imposes limitations on the number of SMS messages a sub-account can send within a 24-hour period. These limits are implemented to help prevent spam and improve overall deliverability rates.

Secondly, HighLevel monitors opt-out rates for each sub-account. If the opt-out rate exceeds a certain threshold, typically around 2%, the sub-account may be temporarily locked, preventing it from sending SMS messages for a 24-hour period.
