## Project Overview

As a senior frontend engineer, I'm currently working on an ecommerce template side project to showcase and enhance my skills with modern web technologies. This work-in-progress project is built on Next.js, chosen for its powerful features like server-side rendering and static site generation, which I aim to utilize more extensively as the project develops.

In its current iteration, the template demonstrates key ecommerce functionalities. I've integrated Sanity.io as a headless CMS, highlighting my proficiency with flexible content management solutions. For payment processing, I've successfully implemented Stripe checkout, ensuring secure transactions and demonstrating my ability to integrate third-party APIs effectively. The UI is crafted using Tailwind CSS in combination with shadcn/ui, showcasing my commitment to developer efficiency and consistent design. This pairing allows for rapid development of a responsive, accessible interface while maintaining a high degree of customization. By using shadcn/ui, which is built on Radix UI primitives, 

I'm emphasizing my focus on creating robust, accessible components. While still in its early stages, this project serves as a solid foundation for a scalable e-commerce application, reflecting my expertise in modern frontend architecture and my approach to building efficient, user-friendly web solutions

## Future Plans

- **Payment Integration Expansion:** I plan to integrate PayPal as an additional payment option in a future version, broadening the template's appeal and showcasing my ability to work with multiple payment gateways.
- **Feature Completion:** My goal is to develop a comprehensive ecommerce experience by adding remaining pages and features typical of full-fledged online stores. This will demonstrate my understanding of complete ecommerce workflows and user experiences.
- **Commercialization:** Once fully developed, I intend to sell the template on online template marketplaces. This step will allow me to gain experience in product packaging, documentation, and potentially customer support for a technical product.
- **Framework Diversification:** To showcase my versatility as a frontend engineer, I plan to create a Vue.js version of the template. This will highlight my ability to work across different frontend frameworks and architectures while maintaining consistent functionality and design.

These future plans underscore my commitment to continuous learning, my understanding of market demands in the web development space, and my ability to adapt solutions to different technological ecosystems.
