## Manage Phone Numbers

LC Phone is a telephony service provider from HighLevel that offers exceptional deliverability, error monitoring, and compliance handling. When compared to other telephony service providers in the market, LC Phone stands out as a much more affordable solution without compromising on quality or features.

## Buy Number Flow (Powered by Stripe)

LC Phone System enables customers to purchase local, mobile, and toll-free phone numbers for selected countries. In countries where regulatory compliance is required, the system allows customers to submit the necessary address and compliance documentation through a very user-friendly experience.

Additionally, to ensure seamless and secure payment transactions, LC Phone System integrates with Stripe, a well-known and trusted payment service provider.

## Managing Verified Caller IDs

Verified Caller ID is a feature that enables client to use their own phone number as the Caller ID for outgoing calls made through HighLevel service. This means that recipients will see client's familiar number on their caller ID display, making the calls more recognizable and trustworthy.

## Add Number Pool Flow

Number pools provide a robust mechanism for tracking calls generated by paid campaigns. Through the implementation of number pools, client can attribute call-tracking conversations to specific phone numbers assigned to leads on designated landing pages and websites.

These phone numbers are exclusively displayed on certain pages and only to leads who perform a predefined action. Often referred to as "call tracking codes," within the HighLevel's system, they are called "number pools."
