## Sign In/Sign Up Flow

As part of my responsibilities at the company, I designed and developed the official website for Attryb, a platform that offers a turnkey studio Stack for businesses. The website showcases Attryb's AI-powered solutions for creating hyper-personalized customer journeys and optimizing every customer touchpoint without compromising customer data.

The landing page was designed and implemented using React.js to effectively communicate Attryb's value proposition and key features. With a clean and modern design, the landing page captures visitors' attention and encourages them to explore the product further.
