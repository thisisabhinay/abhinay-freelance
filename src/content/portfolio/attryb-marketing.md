## Landing Page

As part of my responsibilities at the company, I designed and developed the official website for Attryb, a platform that offers a turnkey Marketing Stack for businesses. The website showcases Attryb's AI-powered solutions for creating hyper-personalized customer journeys and optimizing every customer touchpoint without compromising customer data.

The landing page was designed and implemented using React.js to effectively communicate Attryb's value proposition and key features. With a clean and modern design, the landing page captures visitors' attention and encourages them to explore the product further.

This product page, was dedicated to highlighting the capabilities and benefits of Attryb's Content Studio. Interactive elements and informative sections were implemented using React's state management and event handling capabilities to showcase the product's features and how it can help businesses improve their content creation process.

## Blog Listing

The blog section of the website consists of a blog listing page and individual blog post pages. The blog listing page, developed using React's component composition and data fetching capabilities, showcases Attryb's latest blog posts and articles. Pagination and filtering options were implemented using React's state management to enhance the user experience and make it easy for visitors to find relevant content.

Smooth animations and transitions were implemented to enhance the overall user experience, and the website was optimized for fast loading times and performance, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for visitors. Integration with Attryb's backend APIs was done to fetch dynamic content and data for the blog and pricing sections, and best practices for code organization, maintainability, and scalability were followed throughout the development process.
