## Lead Connector's Integration Page

When the SAAS mode is enabled, agencies can resell the features and tools provided by the platform directly to their clients. This eliminates the need for clients to install any software locally on their devices.

The phone integration page allows users to connect with the telephony features offered by the High Level platform. Alternatively, users can integrate their own third-party telephony service providers, such as Twilio, into the High Level platform.

## Sub-Accounts Management

Subaccounts in High Level are accounts that are "owned" by a main account called an _Agency_. Using subaccounts, an agency owner can segment each of their clients' use of HighLevel features and keep it separate from all the rest. This will allow the agency owner to easily manage the activity and resources of each client independently.

## Numbers Migration

This feature allows agency owners to migrate phone numbers between sub-accounts of a client's external service provider (e.g., Twilio), from Highlevel's agency to the external service provider, or between sub-accounts within Highlevel's agency.
