## Project Overview

As a senior frontend engineer, I recently had the opportunity to work on an exciting project for HighLevel, a comprehensive sales and marketing platform. Our task was to develop a micro frontend web application that would revolutionize how businesses manage their SMS and voicemail settings. The HighLevel SMS and Voicemail Management System is a self-contained, modular solution that integrates various communication settings into a single, user-friendly interface.

This project was born out of the need to simplify complex communication processes for HighLevel's clients. Many businesses struggle with managing multiple communication channels efficiently, often juggling between different platforms for SMS, voicemail, and compliance settings. Our solution aimed to consolidate these features, providing a seamless experience for users while ensuring scalability for future enhancements.

## Objectives

Our project had several key objectives:

1. **Simplify SMS provider integration:** We aimed to create a one-click setup process for HighLevel's built-in SMS provider, Lead Connector (LC), eliminating the need for complex third-party integrations.

2. **Streamline voicemail and missed call management:** Our goal was to develop an intuitive interface for uploading custom voicemail greetings and configuring automated responses to missed calls.

3. **Ensure SMS compliance:** We needed to implement robust features for number validation, opt-out management, and sender identification to help businesses adhere to regulatory requirements.

4. **Implement flexible messaging limits:** We sought to create a system that could enforce SMS sending limits and monitor opt-out rates to maintain high deliverability and prevent spam.

5. **Develop a scalable micro frontend architecture:** Our objective was to build a modular system that could easily accommodate future features and integrations.

## Domain and Industry Context

To fully appreciate the significance of this project, it's essential to understand the landscape of cloud communications and sales & marketing platforms. Traditionally, businesses using sales & marketing platforms like HighLevel had to integrate external services like Twilio for SMS and voice capabilities. This process often required advanced technical knowledge, creating a barrier for many agencies and small businesses.

Twilio, a leader in cloud communications, offers powerful APIs for various communication channels. However, the complexity of managing these integrations can be overwhelming for non-technical users. This is where our project comes in, aiming to provide the robust functionality of a service like Twilio, but with the simplicity and integration that users expect from a mature SaaS platform.

The introduction of LC Phone, HighLevel's custom telephony service provider, marks a significant shift in this space. By developing this in-house solution, we're able to offer improved deliverability, better error monitoring, and enhanced compliance features at a more competitive price point. This move aligns with the industry trend towards more integrated, user-friendly solutions that work "out of the box."

## Features

The HighLevel SMS and Voicemail Management System boasts a range of powerful features designed to streamline communication processes for businesses. Let's dive into each of these features in detail.

### SMS Provider Settings

At the heart of our system is the SMS Provider feature, which simplifies text message communication within the HighLevel platform. We've integrated Lead Connector (LC), HighLevel's built-in SMS provider, to enable effortless sending and receiving of SMS messages. The one-click setup process we've implemented significantly reduces the technical barrier for users, allowing them to start messaging immediately without the need for complex configurations. While users still have the option to integrate external SMS providers, LC offers substantial benefits, including potential cost savings and seamless integration with other HighLevel features.

### Voicemail and Missed Call Settings

Our voicemail settings feature allows clients to personalize their communication with callers who don't reach them directly. Users can easily upload custom voicemail greetings through our intuitive interface, with options to set different greetings for individual phone numbers or apply a universal greeting across their entire HighLevel business profile. We've also implemented a Missed Call Text Back feature, enabling users to preview and automatically send customized text messages to callers who weren't able to connect. This feature helps businesses maintain engagement and responsiveness, even when they can't answer calls in real-time.

### SMS Compliance Settings

Ensuring regulatory compliance was a crucial aspect of our project. We've implemented a robust number validation feature that helps businesses maintain a good sender reputation by reducing undelivered messages. Our system checks the validity of mobile numbers before sending messages, significantly improving delivery rates. We've also built in SMS opt-out settings, which automatically include clear unsubscribe instructions in every message sent. This typically takes the form of a phrase like "Reply STOP to unsubscribe" appended to each message. Additionally, our SMS Sender Info feature ensures that each message clearly identifies the sender, whether by business name or another recognizable identifier, further enhancing transparency and compliance.

### Messaging Limit Settings

To maintain high deliverability rates and prevent potential misuse, we've implemented sophisticated messaging limit settings. Our system applies SMS limits in two key areas. First, we've set up restrictions on the number of SMS messages a sub-account can send within a 24-hour period. This helps prevent spam and maintains overall system integrity. Second, we've implemented a monitoring system for opt-out rates. If a sub-account's opt-out rate exceeds a certain threshold (typically around 2%), the system automatically locks the account for a 24-hour period, preventing further SMS sends. This feature helps maintain a positive reputation for all HighLevel users and encourages responsible messaging practices.

## Outcome

The HighLevel SMS and Voicemail Management System has been successfully deployed and is already making a significant impact. Users have reported a dramatic reduction in the time and effort required to set up and manage their communication settings. The intuitive interface and seamless integration with existing HighLevel features have been particularly well-received.

One of the main challenges we faced during development was ensuring that our micro frontend architecture could seamlessly integrate with the existing HighLevel platform while maintaining independence for future scalability. We overcame this by implementing a robust event system and carefully designing our API interfaces.

A key lesson learned was the importance of continuous user feedback throughout the development process. We set up regular feedback sessions with a group of beta testers, which helped us identify and address usability issues early in the development cycle.

Looking ahead, we have plans to further enhance the system. Some potential improvements include:

1. Implementing AI-powered smart replies for missed calls
2. Expanding language support for voicemail greetings
3. Developing more advanced analytics for message engagement and opt-out trends

## Conclusion

Working on the HighLevel SMS and Voicemail Management System has been an incredibly rewarding experience. As a senior frontend engineer, this project pushed me to think beyond just coding and consider the broader implications of our work on business processes and user experiences.

The challenge of simplifying complex telecommunication concepts into an intuitive interface has significantly enhanced my skills in UX design and system architecture. Moreover, diving deep into SMS compliance regulations and implementing safeguards has given me a newfound appreciation for the intersection of technology and legal requirements in software development.

This project has reinforced my belief in the power of well-designed, user-centric solutions to solve real-world business challenges. It's a testament to how frontend engineering, when done right, can dramatically improve operational efficiency and user satisfaction.

As I reflect on this project, I'm excited about the future possibilities in the realm of integrated communication solutions. The landscape of business communication is constantly evolving, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible in this space.
