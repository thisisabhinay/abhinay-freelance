## Shaken/STIR Registration

Shaken/STIR is a framework in the United States that verifies caller ID information. When you use Shaken/STIR, your phone number undergoes a verification process to confirm that you are the one placing the call. This helps reduce spam calls and increases the likelihood that recipients will answer the phone.

In HighLevel, the system is designed to facilitate adherence to Shaken/STIR compliance requirements through a user-friendly experience, making it easier for businesses to ensure their outgoing calls are verified and trusted.

## CNAM Registration

CNAM, which stands for Caller ID Name, is a technology that associates phone numbers with alphanumeric data that appears on caller ID systems. While CNAM can help prevent fraud, it can also be used to perpetuate fraudulent activities.

In HighLevel, the system is designed to facilitate CNAM registration through a user-friendly experience, making it easier for businesses to ensure their caller ID information is accurately displayed when making outbound calls.

## A2P Messaging Registration

A2P Messaging, short for Application-to-Person Messaging, refers to automated messages sent from a business application to a mobile phone user. This type of messaging is commonly used for business communication and marketing purposes. To ensure that messages are delivered and not blocked by carriers due to spam concerns, A2P registration is mandatory.

HighLevel facilitates the A2P registration process through a user-friendly experience, making it easier for businesses to comply with the requirements and maintain effective communication with their customers via automated messages.
